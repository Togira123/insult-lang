# 2.1 Advanced Thanks

## Task

In INSULT, a `thanks` block allows the most outer scope in that block to omit the `please` keyword at the end of statements:

```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
}
```
But only in the **outer most** scope:
```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
    def i = 0
    while (i < 10) {
        // requires please
        i = i + 1 please
    }
}
```
Of course, you can use another thanks inside of an already existing `thanks` block:
```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
    def i = 0
    thanks while (i < 10) {
        // no please needed
        i = i + 1
    }
}
```
But what happens if you still use a `please` even though you don't need to? Well, the statement is executed twice. This results in an error in the case of variable definitions, but can be perfectly okay in other situations:
```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
    def i = 0
    thanks while (i < 10) {
        i = i + 1 please
        print("this will only be printed 5 times")
    }
}
```
It can be a bit tedious to write `thanks` for every scope, therefore your task is to make the `thanks` block extend to all scopes. For example, if an if statement is defined with `thanks`, you won't need a `please` **anywhere** inside of it:
```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
    def i = 0
    while (i < 10) {
        // won't require please anymore
        i = i + 1
    }
}
```
But, with a twist. If you still write a `please` inside of a `thanks` block, the statement isn't executed twice, but twice for every `thanks` encapsulating the scope (so 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of `thanks` encapsulating the scope):
```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
    def i = 0
    thanks while (i < 10) {
        // is executed 4 times because there are 2 thanks (2^2 = 4)
        i = i + 1 please
        thanks if (i == 8) {
            // 2^3 = 8
            print("this is printed 8 times") please
        }
        if (i == 4) {
            // 2^2 = 4
            print("only printed 4 times") please
        }
    }
    // 2^1 = 2
    print("this statement is executed twice") please
}
```
