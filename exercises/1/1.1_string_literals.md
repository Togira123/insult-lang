# 1.1 String Literals

## Task

INSULT allows string literals to be defined by enclosing the string with double quotes:
```c++
def my_string = "hello world" please
```
You can use the exact same syntax to also define multiline strings:
```c++
def multiline_string = "this is
a
multiline
string" please
```
That leads to the following inconvenience: if you want to use double quotes themselves in a string, you need to escape them like this:
```c++
def escaped_string = "an escaped \" double quotes character" please
```
That's why your task is to also allow strings to be defined with single quotes like this:
```c++
def escaped_string2 = 'using the " double quotes character is no problem now' please
```
This way, people can choose between using single or double quotes for their strings.
