# 1.2 Thousands Separator

## Task

Numbers – integers and doubles – can be defined like the following code shows:
```c++
def simple_int = 1234 please
def simple_double = 3.14 please
```
But now assume that you need to work with big numbers:
```c++
def large_int = 5028098601848710349 please
```
That number is hard to read. That's why your task is introduce a thousands separator for numbers. The character used to separate should be `'` and it should only be allowed to be placed in places where it makes sense (it's INSULT after all). What that means is that a `'` should only be allowed to be placed after each three digits starting from the end of the integer or from the last digit before the decimal point in case of doubles. Additionally, if any `'` are used, then they **need** to be used for the whole number:
```c++
def n1 = 1'000 please // legal integer
def n2 = 10'000 please // legal integer as well
def n3 = 1'0'00 please // the placing doesn't follow the required pattern of every third digit
def n4 = 1000'000 please // the one separator is correct, but it's missing another right after the 1.
def n5 = 1'000'000.1234 please // legal double
def n6 = 100'000'00.1 please // the separators have to start three digits before the decimal point
def n7 = 100'000.123'456 please // separators in decimals are not allowed
def n8 = 100000000 please // legal integer (not using any separators is still allowed)
```
