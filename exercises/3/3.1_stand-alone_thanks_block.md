# 3.1 Stand-alone Thanks Block

## Task

In INSULT, a `thanks` block allows the most outer scope in that block to omit the `please` keyword at the end of statements:

```c++
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
}
```
The `thanks` keyword can be placed before `for`, `if` and `while` statements as well as before function definitions:
```c++
thanks for (def i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1)Â {
    print(i) // no please needed -> in outer most scope of the for statement
}
thanks if (a == b) {
    print("no need for please")
} else {
    print("still in thanks block")
}
def c = return_three() please // not inside of any thanks block, needs please
thanks while (c >= 0) {
    c = c - 1 // inside of thanks block
}
thanks fun return_three() {
    return 3 // no please needed as well
}
```
For more info about the `thanks` keyword, you can check out the [previous exercise](2.1_advanced_thanks.md).

Your task is to create so-called stand-alone thanks blocks, which can be used anywhere in the code. They would look like the following code snippet shows and have the exact same behavior as a `thanks` used before other statements:
```c++
thanks {
    print("no need for please")
    for (def i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
        // requires please as this is not the outer most scope anymore
        print(i) please
    }
}
```
